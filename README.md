You can analyze sentiment using **Logistic Regression** by following these steps:  

### **Step 1: Data Collection (Scraping Social Media Data)**  
- Use **Tweepy** (for Twitter) or **BeautifulSoup** (for web scraping) to collect social media post titles.  
- Store the collected data in a structured format (CSV or database).  

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**  
- **Convert text to lowercase** to maintain consistency.  
- **Remove stopwords** (common words like "the", "is", "and" that donâ€™t add much meaning).  
- **Tokenization** (splitting text into words).  
- **Convert text into numerical form** using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.  

### **Step 3: Train Logistic Regression Model**  
- Split data into **training and testing sets** (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).  
- Train a **Logistic Regression model** using **Scikit-Learn**:  

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample data (replace with real scraped data)
texts = ["This product is amazing!", "Worst experience ever.", "It's okay, nothing special."]
labels = [1, 0, 2]  # 1: Positive, 0: Negative, 2: Neutral

# Convert text data to numerical features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

### **Step 4: Sentiment Prediction & Analysis**  
- Take new social media posts and **convert them into TF-IDF format**.  
- Use the trained **Logistic Regression model** to predict sentiment.  
- Display results in a **Flask-based web app** or a simple report.  

Example prediction:  
```python
new_text = ["I love this movie!"]
new_text_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(new_text)
sentiment = model.predict(new_text_vectorized)

print(f"Predicted Sentiment: {sentiment[0]}")
```
(Outputs: **1 for Positive, 0 for Negative, 2 for Neutral**)  

### **Step 5: Insights & Visualization**  
- Count the number of **positive, negative, and neutral** posts.  
- Create **bar charts or pie charts** using **Matplotlib/Seaborn** to show sentiment distribution.
